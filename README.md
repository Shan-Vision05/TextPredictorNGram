# NGramSentencePredictor  

## Description  
This repository contains a sentence prediction model based on **bigram** and **trigram** language modeling techniques using the **NLTK corpus**. The project leverages **n-gram probabilities** to predict the next word in a given text, utilizing **statistical language modeling**.  

The implementation includes **data preprocessing, tokenization, and frequency analysis** using **NLTK’s built-in corpora**, such as the **Brown, Gutenberg, or WebText corpus**. This project serves as a fundamental introduction to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and can be extended to more advanced **Markov models or deep learning approaches**.  

## Features  
- ✅ **Uses NLTK corpus** for training language models  
- ✅ Implements **bigram** and **trigram** models for prediction  
- ✅ Supports **custom text datasets** for training  
- ✅ Provides **probability-based word predictions**  
- ✅ Clean and modular **Python implementation**  

## Dependencies  
- Python 3.x  
- NLTK (`pip install nltk`)
